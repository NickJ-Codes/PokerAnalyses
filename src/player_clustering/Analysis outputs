Cluster 0: "The Loose Passive Fish"
Title: The Loose Passive Fish
Description: This player is extremely loose, with a very high VPIP of 44.5% and a low PFR of 13.5%, meaning they play a wide range of hands but rarely raise preflop. They call a lot and fold to 3-bets almost half of the time. Their flop aggression factor (AF) is low, and they donk bet very infrequently. They have a very high fold to flop continuation bet (cbet) frequency of 58.6%, which shows they're passive post-flop. Their winrate is significantly negative at -29.38 BB/100, indicating poor decision-making and an inability to capitalize on post-flop opportunities.
Exploitative Strategy: Apply heavy pressure by raising pre-flop frequently to exploit their weak 3-bet defense. Post-flop, fire large c-bets, as they are likely to fold too often. Take advantage of their weak post-flop play by applying aggression on later streets (turn and river), especially if they show weakness. Avoid slow-playing strong hands, as they are likely to fold unless they have a strong hand.

Cluster 1: "The Solid Regs"
Title: The Solid Regs
Description: This player is a solid, relatively tight player with a moderate VPIP of 39.8% and a PFR of 15.8%. They don’t 3-bet often (8.5%) and have a high fold-to-3-bet frequency (56.4%), indicating they're more passive when facing 3-bets. They c-bet frequently (67.9%), but they also fold to c-bets 50% of the time, suggesting they may not always have strong hands post-flop. Their flop aggression factor is decent (1.95), and their winrate is positive at 14.44 BB/100, showing solid, profitable play.
Exploitative Strategy: Use moderate aggression, particularly on the flop with c-bets. Be selective in 3-betting, as they will fold a decent amount of the time. Don't over-bluff against them post-flop, as they have decent fold equity. If you have strong hands, make value bets on the turn and river, as they are likely to call with a range of reasonable hands.

Cluster 2: "The Hyper-aggro Maniacs"
Title: The Hyper-aggro Maniacs
Description: This player is extremely loose, with a VPIP of 71.3%, meaning they play almost every hand. Their PFR of 19.9% indicates they raise a large portion of hands, making them a very aggressive pre-flop player. They have a low fold-to-3-bet percentage (29.9%) and show little concern for folding when re-raised. However, their winrate is devastatingly negative at -203.46 BB/100, indicating that while they play aggressively, their aggression is often unfounded and leads to significant losses.
Exploitative Strategy: The primary strategy should be to trap them with premium hands pre-flop and post-flop. Their loose aggression can be exploited by calling or slow-playing hands that are likely to hit big on the flop. If they bet frequently on later streets, check-raise or raise for value. This player will often continue with marginal hands, so don’t be afraid to apply significant pressure when you have a strong hand.

Cluster 3: "The Tight Passive"
Title: The Tight Passive
Description: This player is relatively tight, with a VPIP of 30.6% and a low PFR of 12.4%. They rarely 3-bet and fold frequently to 3-bets (69.7%). Their flop aggression factor is low (1.82), and they don’t donk bet much. Their c-bet frequency is moderate (61.95%), and they fold to c-bets 51.6% of the time, indicating they can be exploited by firing multiple streets with aggression. They have a negative winrate of -5.12 BB/100, suggesting they're not making the most of their tight approach.
Exploitative Strategy: Apply pressure with raises and 3-bets, especially in position, as they are likely to fold too often. Post-flop, they will likely fold to aggression, so make larger c-bets to take down pots. Take advantage of their passiveness by value-betting your strong hands and bluffing when they show weakness.

Cluster 4: "The Loose Aggro Fish"
Title: The Loose Aggro Fish
Description: This player is fairly loose with a VPIP of 61.8% but has a relatively low PFR of 16.1%, indicating they like to play many hands but don’t raise pre-flop aggressively. They 3-bet moderately (10.2%) and fold to 3-bets 41.6% of the time. They have a high flop donk frequency (25.2%) and a solid c-bet frequency (62.5%). Despite this, their winrate is significantly negative at -103.89 BB/100, indicating poor post-flop play and an inability to capitalize on their loose pre-flop range.
Exploitative Strategy: This player can be exploited by 3-betting and taking the initiative pre-flop, as they will often fold to 3-bets. Post-flop, expect them to donk bet with a wide range, so be cautious when they take the lead. They may fold too often to pressure on later streets, so apply pressure on the turn and river when they show weakness. Value-bet your strong hands and avoid slow-playing.

Cluster 5: "The Moderate Aggressor"
Title: The Moderate Aggressor
Description: This player is moderately loose, with a VPIP of 43.0% and a low PFR of 11.7%. They 3-bet somewhat infrequently (7.5%) and fold to 3-bets 61.9%. They don’t donk bet much (27.8%), but they have a strong c-bet frequency of 73.8%. Their winrate of -17.53 BB/100 is negative, suggesting that while they’re aggressive post-flop, their overall decision-making leads to losses.
Exploitative Strategy: Take advantage of their weak pre-flop play by raising hands in position and applying pressure. Post-flop, fire larger c-bets and pressure them on later streets, especially on the river. They will often fold to continued aggression, and they are likely to overfold on weak boards. Play tight against their raises, as their aggression tends to be weaker overall.

Cluster 6: "The Big-Betting Fish"
Title: The Big-Betting Fish
Description: This player is moderately loose, with a VPIP of 53.4%, and has a low PFR of 14.1%. They 3-bet infrequently (8.8%) and fold to 3-bets 50.2% of the time. They have a solid c-bet frequency (66.9%) and donk bet moderately (23.4%). Their river bet frequency (44.7%) is high, indicating they can be aggressive on later streets. Despite the moderate aggression, their winrate is negative at -56.76 BB/100, suggesting they may be too aggressive or too loose with weak hands.
Exploitative Strategy: Apply selective aggression, particularly pre-flop and on the flop. Since they bet aggressively on the river, take advantage of their loose pre-flop play by calling them down with hands that can comfortably withstand river aggression. Be wary of their donk bets on the flop, but don't be afraid to apply pressure when they show weakness.
